# [The Ultimate Introduction to Modern GUIs in Python](https://youtu.be/mop6g-c5HEY?si=bMJ707i9YMEMN7lP)

Ready to build real apps with Python? Let's do this!

## Background

You're ready to up your skills as a software developer and make yourself valuable.

Not only will you need to be a great computer scientist that knows how to apply the proper algorithms and data structures to build efficient and complex programs, you need to build usable products for people! That's where GUIs come in.

Building apps might seem like a chore or a challenge to build confidence in, but its necessary if you want your software solutions to be marketable. You can have really great APIs, but even those won't sell if people can't see how they can be used in reality.

Along with the short stories you want to write, it could be good practice to build *short apps*, short applications that solve a specific problem or perform some specific function. Relate them to the stories that you will write.

This will also help you prepare for your OMSCS degree at GT where python will be a necessary skill.
